# soundfish

> A Soundcloud port for SailfishOS

## Basic concept

- Qt5, QML and Python app featuring native SailfishOS UI
- Reuse QML components of Cutespotify https://github.com/lukedirtwalker/cutespotify
- Prefer pyotherside with Python 3 to C++
- [SoundCloud dev page](https://developers.soundcloud.com/)

## Community
- There was another project launched [here](https://github.com/rollator/sound-for-fish) but app is still in very early development. 
- There is a community discussion thread [here](https://together.jolla.com/question/66652/soundcloud-sailfish-os-application/?comment=93982#comment-93982) referring to the above project.
