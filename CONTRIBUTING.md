# CONTRIBUTING

First of all, thank you for your attempt to improve soundfish.
The follow paragraphs cover a few guidelines that contributors need to follow so that we can have a a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Reporting An Issue
If you are looking to raise an issue because you think you have found a problem,
or you would like to make a request for a new feature, or any other reason ... here is what you should do.

- Search for existing issues. If you found an issue targeting what you want to do, stick to that one and comment it.

- Otherwise, just create a new issue.

## Feature Requests
If you have collaboration access to the project, create a new feature branch. Otherwise, fork the project.

- Prefix feature branch names with `feature/`.

You probably want to create your feature branch based on the codebase in the master branch.

- Create a new Pull Request for your feature branch so discussions regarding the feature can be held on that PR.

If you want to attach a Pull Request to an existing issue, here is what you could do.
- Github does [not yet support this feature](https://twitter.com/GitHubHelp/status/18475695785115648) officially. So if you want your commits being listed in your previously created issue, check out [Issue to Pull Request](http://issue2pr.herokuapp.com/) or [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4528869/how-do-you-attach-a-new-pull-request-to-an-existing-issue-on-github) SO thread.

- Feel free to add pages to the project wiki if you prefer that to comments in issues.
